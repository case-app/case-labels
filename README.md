# case-labels

## Why thos labels
Case label allows to bring consistency in our github projects. Each CASE repos must have these labels.

## Use those labels on a project

Add case labels following those steps:

1. Got to your github repository/issues/labels
2. Open your console and past the script `labels.json`
3. Press enter
4. Update the colors manually

> These labels are applied for CASE repos. If you want to use them for a new CASE project or another project, you have to replace `CASE elements` labels with those of your own project elements.
